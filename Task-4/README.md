# Snake
## Why this project?
I chose this one because I didn't really have any other code that I remember than this and my 12th grade CS project, which uses concepts like classes and files and acts as a interface which helps in recruitment by connecting recruiters and job applicants. Among these two, I chose this(Because the other one needs more explaining). But I'm glad that I did this code(actually that one too) on my own without pretty much any reference/help other than my learning and maybe few syntax(that's why there are some errors still...).

## What does it offer the user?
* Thought of "Why out of million things to do, I ended up here"(JK...I hope so...).
* Snake game simulation.
  * 'wasd' controls to move the so called snake.
  * red color 'O' that pretends to be a fruit.
  * score that provides competition.
> Disclaimer: I'm not calling this a serious project/game since it is learning markdown language, so please don't hate me. This is just a mere attempt by me to test graphics in c++ in 12th grade. 
  NOTE: This code was done using Turbo C++. Converting this into dev C++ is in progress.
