# Snake
## Why this project?
I chose this one because I didn't really have any other code other than this and my 12th grade CS project, which uses 12th grade concepts like classes and files and acts as a interface which helps in recruitment by connecting recruiters and job applicants. Among these two, I chose this(because it's not complicated for me). But I'm confident that I did this code(actually that one too) on my own without pretty much any reference/help other than my learning and few syntax(that's why there are errors still...).
## What does it offer the user?
* Thought of "Why out of million things to do, I ended up here"(JK...I hope so...).
* Snake game simulation.
  * wasd controls to move the snake like thing.
  * red color 'O' that pretends to be a fruit.
  * score that provides competition.
> Disclaimer: I'm not calling this a project/game, so don't hate me. This is just a mere attempt by me to test graphics in c++.
