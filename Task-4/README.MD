# Snake
## Why this project?
I chose this one because I didn't really have any other code other than this and my 12th grade CS project, which is uses 12th grade concepts like classes and files and acts as a interface which helps in recruitment by connecting recruiters and job applicants. Among these two, I chose this. But I'm confident that I did this code(actually that one too) on my own without pretty much no reference/help(that's why there are errors still...).
## What does it offer the user?
* Thought of "Why out of million things to do, I ended up here"(JK...I hope so...).
* Snake game simulation.
  * wasd controls to move the snake like thing.
  * red color 'O' that pretends to be a fruit.
  * score that increments the points from the fruit
