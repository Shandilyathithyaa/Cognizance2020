This programs takes an integer input from the user and checks whether it is an armstrong number or not

Get the input from the user and store it in a variable N
Initialize variables Sum=0,Temp=N
While (Temp/10)>0:
    Add Cube(Temp%10) to Sum
    Assign Temp as Temp/10
Check if N=Sum:
    if True:
        print response "The given number is an armstrong number"
    else:
        print response "The given number is NOT an armstrong number"
End
